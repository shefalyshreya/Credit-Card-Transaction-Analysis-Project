 **Description**
  This project analyzes the Kaggle Credit Card Transactions dataset. It demonstrates:
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and distributions in the dataset
  SQL queries for ad-hoc analysis and insights, including:
    - JOINs to combine multiple tables
     - GROUP BY / HAVING for aggregated analysis
     - Window functions for running totals and ranking
      - Subqueries and CTEs for complex calculations
       - Stored procedures for automated trend analysis and high-risk transaction detection
The analysis covers transactions by card type, expense type, city, gender, and time trends, helping identify usage patterns and high-risk behaviors.
